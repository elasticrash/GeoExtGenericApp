# GeoExtGenericApp
A Generic GeoExt2 Client for GeoServer

All you need to do to get it working is 

- changing the Config.js File located at web/js/libs/
- Running it on a Tomcat WebServer (requires a proxy servlet to bypass the cross-origin error of the wfs requests)
- obviously adding your Geoserver Address to the python proxy
